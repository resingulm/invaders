# Data Model: Game Sound Effects

This feature is purely focused on adding sound effects to existing game events. It does not introduce any new persistent data models, modify existing game state data structures, or require any new entities. All relevant game state (e.g., player position, score, lives) continues to be managed within the Phaser scenes as per the existing game architecture.

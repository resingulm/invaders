# Research: Documentation Cleanup

## Decision: Direct Implementation of Documentation Changes

- **Decision**: The documentation cleanup tasks will be implemented directly as specified in the feature specification, without requiring extensive research into alternative approaches.
- **Rationale**: The tasks involve straightforward file content manipulation and restructuring of existing markdown files. The chosen approach is efficient and directly addresses the user's request.
- **Alternatives Considered**: No significant alternatives were considered as the task is well-defined and does not present complex technical challenges requiring alternative solutions.

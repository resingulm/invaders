# Constitution for Our Web-Based Game

## 1. Vision

Our primary vision is to create a fun, engaging, and accessible web-based game that can be played by anyone, anywhere, without the need for installation. The game should be lightweight, responsive, and visually appealing.

## 2. Gameplay Principles

- **Easy to Learn, Hard to Master:** The game should be simple enough for new players to pick up quickly, but with enough depth to keep them engaged long-term.
- **Player First:** All design and development decisions should prioritize the player's experience.
- **Fair Play:** The game should be balanced and fair. Any in-game purchases should not create a "pay-to-win" environment.

## 3. Technical Principles

- **Web First:** The game will be built using standard web technologies (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript/TypeScript) to ensure maximum compatibility across modern browsers.
- **Performance:** The game must be optimized for performance to run smoothly on a wide range of devices, including low-end laptops and mobile devices.
- **Open Source:** We will use open-source libraries and frameworks where possible and contribute back to the community.

## 4. Community

- **Feedback:** We will actively listen to player feedback and use it to improve the game.
- **Transparency:** We will be transparent with our community about the development process, including our successes and failures.
- **Inclusivity:** We will foster a welcoming and inclusive community for all players.

## 5. Monetization

- **Ethical Monetization:** If the game is monetized, it will be done in an ethical and transparent manner.
- **Value:** Any in-game purchases should provide real value to the player.
- **No Pay-to-Win:** As stated in the gameplay principles, monetization will not create an unfair advantage for paying players.
